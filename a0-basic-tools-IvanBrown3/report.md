This picture depicts a map that shows the reader the number of evictions near tech bus stops. The map shows data from 2011-2013 during the time of the Ellis Act Evictions. These evictions were considered "no fault" evictions because property owners saw the potential gains they could make financially by claiming that they were going out of rental business. In this way, homeowners could remodel their homes into multi-unit homes that they could upsell for a tremendous profit, 

> "Because a new, wealthy clientele began to seek condos near the bus stops, property values soaredâ€”and so did the rate of evictions of long-time neighborhood residents."

This is important idea to understand as it was a very big contributor to the increased income gap in the city of San Francisco.
